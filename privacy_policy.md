# Privacy Policy

*Jun 26, 2023*

Privacy is a big part of why Scoria exists. Your location data reveals a
tremendous amount about who you are. Yet there is a lack of effective tools for
privately collecting and analyzing this data. Our goal is to make tools which
are not only private and secure, but also help you better understand your own
private information.

## No Data Shared Unless Explicitly Consented

Scoria's purpose is to help you privately collect and analyze your own personal
data. Data collected by the app is kept on your device and is only accessible to
you. Scoria does not automatically collect any logged data, usage statistics, or
personally-identifiable information. Your private data will never be shared with
anyone (including us) without your explicit consent.

"Explicit consent" means that you are aware your information is being shared
when it happens, that you are aware what information is being shared, and that
you are voluntarily agreeing to share. Currently, this can only happen if you
submit feedback to us, like when reporting a bug on our website.

## Third-Party Maps

Scoria uses a third-party maps provider to show you maps in the app. The
provider is Maptiler AG, and their privacy policy is available
[here](https://www.maptiler.com/privacy-policy/). We have selected Maptiler for
their privacy-forward and readable privacy policy.

Map areas you view in Scoria are loaded from Maptiler's servers. When you open
the map, your approximate viewing region is sent to Maptiler so the map data for
that region can be downloaded. When you move to a new area of the map, the new
map data is requested from Maptiler if it hasn't already been downloaded in that
viewing session. Maptiler states that they do not use this information for
anything except to provide you map data and prevent malicious activity on their
servers. In Scoria, private information displayed over the map is never sent to
Maptiler.

Aside from Maptiler, information is not sent to any other third parties.

## Summary

- Scoria does not automatically collect any data from you.
- Scoria will always ask for your explicit consent before sharing your data with
  anyone.
- Map data is downloaded to your device over the internet from our third-party
  maps provider, Maptiler AG.
